# About

Large ships can dock just as many fighers as XL ships. This mod changes small ship docking storage for large ships to 10, and for medium ships to 1. This is an attempt to bring the docking in line so that Frigates can store 1 small ship, large ships can storage 10 small ships and 1 medium ships, and XL ships can store 40 small ships and 10 medium ships. In other words each ship size up for each storage size goes from 1 --> 10 --> 40.

This mod will only work on new ships as there is no way to replace ship storage.

# What Is Modified?

* Ship storage macros for each large ship.
